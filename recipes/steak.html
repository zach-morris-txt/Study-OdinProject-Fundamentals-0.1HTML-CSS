        <h2>Popular in Brazil, Picanha is one of the most flavorful cuts of beef.</h2>
        <p>
            Taken from the top of the rump, you might know of it as a rump cover, rump cap, sirloin cap or 
            even culotte steak. It is triangular in shape and surrounded by a thick layer of fat called a fat 
            cap. Because it is not an overused muscle, this cut remains beautifully tender.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Picanha (alternatively known as "Sirloin Cap")</li>
            <li>Red's Sea Salt</li>
            <li>Chimichurri</li>
            <li>Charcoal & Charcoal Grill (for best result)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Before starting the process, make sure that your meat cuts are 2-3 inches thick</li>
            <li>If meat has been refrigerated, take it out 1hour before starting</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your grill at 300째F or High setting.</li>
            <li>Cut fat layer to about 1/4".</li>
            <li>Rub in sea salt (Picanha is naturally filled with flavor and it's advised to cook
                as is, though a BBQ dry rub is a good selection for those who must season).
            </li>
            <li>If using a gas grill, turn off all the burners except for the furthest burner from the 
                steak. It is recommended to cook the meat with the lid closed, for around 20-25 minutes, 
                turning them every 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>If using a charcoal grill, make sure the cooking temperature is at approximately 300째F.
                Skewer the meat and lay on the coals.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the heat when it reaches an internal temperature of 130-135째F for 
                medium-rare doneness. If you prefer medium doneness, leave it until it reaches 135-140째F 
                internal temperature.
            </li>
            <li>For best taste, let the meat rest for 10-15minutes to ensure the juices don't immediately 
                evacuate.
            </li>
        </ol>
