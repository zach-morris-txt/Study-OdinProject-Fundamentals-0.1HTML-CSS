[HTML, HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE] 
    Determines the structure of documents and webpages; the bones of
    the website.
    Semantic HTML - using tags in their appropriate places/contexts


[HTML DOCUMENT BOILERPLATE]
    *Within index.HTML*
    Doctype - tells server what version of HTML (standard shown is HTML5) 
        <!DOCTYPE html>    
    Root element - all other elements descend from this <html lang="en"> </html>
    Head element - container for meta-information <head> </head>
    Charset encoding - allows server to display characters <meta charset="utf-8">
    Webpage title element - <title> </title>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>My First Webpage</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            *elements intended for display here*
        </body>
    </html>


[LINKING RESOURCES]
    Anchor element - links to other resources using href attribute (hypertext reference)
        *defaults to opening resource in same tab
        *target attribute handles where the resource opens Ex. target="_blank" (new tab)
        *relation attribute handles the relation between the current page and linked 
            resource Ex. rel="noopener noreferrer" (no access to page and no knowledge of 
            which page opened it, good security measure against phishing)
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
            noreferrer">click me</a>
    Absolute Link - directs user to a different website; contains "protocol://domain/path"
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
    Relative Links - directs user to a new page within site; does not contain domain
    	<a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
        *Good practice to not crowd index.html at root, create directory for further pages*

    Image element - links to images using src (source) attribute; can be local or external
        *Img element should include an alt (alternative text) attribute which acts as a
            placeholder for the image when not visible and provides a description such that
            screenreaders for the blind can announce it*
        <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="Odin Project Logo">
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="Pug wearing a scarf">
    Accessing these resources from parent directories is a matter of pointing in the 
        correct direction, "../" accomplishes this.
        <img src="../images/dog.jpg" alt="Pug wearing a scarf">
